# Performance-Aware Programming coursework

Me running through [Performance-Aware Programming](https://www.computerenhance.com) in Rust.
There are *certainly* bugs in the 8086 simulator code; I mostly just bashed it out without thinking very hard, and without testing it except by using Casey's provided tests.
It does, however, conform to all Casey's provided test cases except the "completionist decode" one.

## Licensing

The code in this repo is MIT-licensed.

However, note that the included submodule is licensed *very* restrictively, and you might not even be permitted to clone it.
